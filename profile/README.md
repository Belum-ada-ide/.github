## Introduction
This project is focused on providing consumers with a platform to access locally sourced, sustainably produced food. We aim to develop an application that enables consumers to browse and purchase food products directly from local farmers. The application will incorporate machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations based on consumer preference. This project will also provide consumers with information on the nutritional value of different foods and detect signs of spoilage or damage in food products through computer vision technology.
